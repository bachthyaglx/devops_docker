> **EXERCISE 3.2: Deployment pipeline to a cloud service**
> 
> In Exercise 1.16 you deployed a containerized app to a cloud service.

> Now it is time to improve your solution by setting up a deployment pipeline for it so that every push to GitHub results in a new deployment to the cloud service.

> You will most likely find a ready-made GitHub Action that does most of the heavy lifting for you... Google is your friend!

> Submit a link to the repository with the config. The repository README should have a link to the deployed application.
