> **EXERCISE 2.5: SCALE**
> 
> The project https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/scaling-exercise is a barely working application. Go ahead and clone it for yourself. The project already includes docker-compose.yml so you can start it by running `docker compose up`.
> 
> The application should be accessible through http://localhost:3000. However it doesn't work well enough and we've added a load balancer for scaling. Your task is to scale the `compute` containers so that the button in the application turns green.
> 
> This exercise was created with [Sasu MÃ¤kinen](https://github.com/sasumaki)
> 
> Submit the used commands for the answer.

## Solution
